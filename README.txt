Charles Wallace Jeffries                                                                                   

The "Main" class is where the code is ran. The main class calls on the BattleboatsBoard class to build the board, and to play the game. This program was written in Java, and utilized the IDe, Intellij. 

When shooting at the other ships, it is important to know that the program asks for an input for the column first and the row next. The input should be a valid integer that is within the bounds.

My board places boats in different patterns depending on a random number generated and on the board size. I hope you enjoy playing the game.


Thank you very much.

Best,
Charlie
